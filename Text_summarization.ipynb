It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area.

In these three experiences, I personal ly felt proud of our \\never vigilant Soldiers, Sailors and Air Warriors performing their  tasks beyond the call of \\ntheir duty even in the most adverse circumstances natural and man m ade. During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state police personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting into practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen.

      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question and assured the person that their dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and worked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the importance of empowering villages and mobilizing rural core competencies to make India a developed country by 2020. The speaker shares his experience visiting a village in Nagaland, where he saw a prosperous and empowered village council taking decisions and making progress. He emphasizes the need for physical connectivity through quality roads to enable faster movement of products from villages to markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also mentions the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women's initiative, Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas (PURA), which involves connecting 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs through physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity.

      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech emphasizes the importance of empowering villages and connecting them with urban societies to achieve India's development goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the success of the Periyar PURA (Pilot Urban Rural Development Agency) project in Thanjavur district, which has generated employment and created entrepreneurs through the support of 1000 self-help groups. The project has transformed 200 acres of wasteland into cultivable land, where villagers are growing Jatropha, herbal, and medicinal plants, as well as generating power using biomass and processing food. The project has also established marketing centers, providing a sustainable economic development model for the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also highlights the partnership between the villagers and experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) and Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women, which has enabled the development of 55 internationally competitive lifestyle products. This has enhanced the innovative abilities of the villagers and enabled them to produce internationally acceptable products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker concludes that similar PURA projects are needed across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide, with an estimated 7000 such projects required to achieve this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares their enriching experience of meeting over 6,000 farmers from across India at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where they showed great interest in various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasizes the importance of doubling agricultural production while reducing land, water, and manpower, and improving the country's economic conditions through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. They express confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through partnerships between farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker then shares a personal experience from a meeting with a disabled individual, Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who has no hands or legs but is full of joy and confidence. Krishna Murthy asks the speaker to allow him to sing in front of everyone, which the speaker agrees to. The experience serves as a reminder to \"defeat problems and succeed\" and to focus on empowering individuals to overcome challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the importance of overcoming challenges and finding ways to give back to others. The speaker shares a personal experience about a young man who was physically challenged but had a talent for music. Despite his disability, he was able to sing beautifully and inspire others. The speaker notes that this is a great example of how people can overcome challenges with positive attitude and perseverance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also highlights the resilience of the people of Jammu & Kashmir, who were affected by a devastating earthquake in 2005. The speaker visited a village called Urusa, which had been adopted by the Air Force for providing relief and medical aid. Despite the severe damage to the school building, the villagers were able to overcome their problems and become stronger as a result. The speaker concludes that it is possible to overcome the impact of disasters through partnership and collective efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be about the speaker's experiences with courage in the face of calamities and the importance of connectivity for societal transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker recalls visiting a village after an earthquake and witnessing the bravery of children and villagers who participated in relief operations with the Armed Forces. The speaker also mentions an instance during their visit to Car Nicobar Islands in 2005, where they met tribal council leaders and students who had taken in victims of the 2004 tsunami as their own, showing remarkable courage and resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also references a poem they composed, \"Sea Waves\", which is a tribute to the courage of the Car Nicobar islanders. The poem is about the challenges posed by the sea and the importance of having the courage to overcome them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the speaker mentions addressing the Pan African Parliament in 2004, where they emphasized the importance of connectivity for societal transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses a project called the \"Pan African e-Network\" aimed at connecting all 53 African countries with a seamless and integrated network of satellite, fiber optics, and wireless connections at an estimated cost of $100 million. The project involves connecting 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Africa), 17 hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), and 53 tele-medicine and tele-education centers across Africa. A pilot project has already been launched in Ethiopia, with the Indira Gandhi National Open University offering an MBA course to 34 students from Addis Ababa and Harmaya Universities. Additionally, specialists from CARE Hospital in India are providing tele-medicine services to African countries.\n",

      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing the Lead India 2020 Foundation, a program that aims to transform young people into enlightened citizens. The program, led by Dr. N.B. Sudershan, has been implemented in many districts of Andhra Pradesh, with visible results such as increased self-discipline, love for parents and teachers, and a sense of duty towards the nation. The speaker shares a personal anecdote about a student leader who inspired her father to quit smoking after participating in the program. The speaker believes that empowering the youth through value-based education and leadership is crucial for the country's progress. The goal is to harness the potential of the 540 million youth below the age of 25, who are considered the most powerful resource on the earth.\n",
      "\n",
